 - I found the leading question to be lacking important details about your implementation. I could not find your leading question to be present in this paragraph. You have described what you would do to the dataset, but not why you're analyzing your graph this way, and the question that you're trying to answer by doing this analysis.
  - I believe your complexity analysis for Dijkstra's Algorithm is faulty, or missing the details that would explain how you achieved this complexity bound.
  - I found this sentence in particular to be confusing "Finding the node with the most network connected within a designated area" 

  - You've greatly improved your proposal, the leading questions are clearly explained, and the proposed algorithms to answer those questions are described in a meaningful way. I'm not a 100% certain whether or not you can get the most important, "popular" node by taking the eigenvector of the adjacency matrix, but since it's an extra point that you've added I don't think its not that big of a concern.
 - In addition, the runtime calculation for Dijkstra's Algorithm has been cleared up, overall great job! I've updated your grade, please reach out if you have any questions.
