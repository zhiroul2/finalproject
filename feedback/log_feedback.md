# For 4/3: 

## Grade: 100% 

## Comments: 

- Your devlog could be more than the same information that you've put into your commit messages. 
- In addition to this, you should also have more descriptive commit messages. Instead of using verbs like updated, created or edited \*.cpp or \*.h, try giving more detail such as: "fixed unsigned int overflow bug in edgeData" or "implemented copy constructor for graph object". 
- Moreover, I'd like to see more of how you guys have worked, ie did you meet somewhere online/in person, how many hours did you think you put in that week, or did you have any other commitments that affected your work. 
- These are all not specified in the rubric, and not technically required of you to a certain degree, but I believe they will make for a greater read for someone who hasn't seen your project at all!

## Comments: 

- Better description of work done, succinct but gets the point across.
- Great acknowledgment of where you're standing with respect to your schedule, you could add an updated plan in a future dev log to really concretely set new goals for your overhanging tasks.
