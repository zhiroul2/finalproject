Started the shortest path algorithm implementation. Fixed some bugs. Started writing the tests
for other functions.


Summary:

Overall in a good standing.We would be able to present our work in mid-term check in.Faster than what we previosuly assumed and the major part of the class is done.
If we get lucky, we would have more time during the final period.Also our members are active in thinking ideas and talking through their problems.
